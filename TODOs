is_annual_renewal field with boolean type is added in the supabase 'users_videos' table.
assigned_date field with timestamptz is added in the supabase 'users_videos' table.
add the is_annual_renewal field in a video form when create the 'videos' record
when saving assigning the video to users
    no record: set the assigned_date to now()
    has record: don't change
    has record but unselect: remove the 'users_videos' record.(check if that's the case)

when clicks on 'watch it again(required)'
    reset the assigned_date

refactor the code according to Tyler's suggestion.
